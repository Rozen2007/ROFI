## Why should you use Netlify  in your App??🤔
**Few months ago, I wanted a quick, fast and easy way to showcase a small project I worked on using Javascript and shared hosting seemed like too much stress for me (I mean, I am still trying to understand a lot). Few random Google search later, I found Netlify and I have never looked back ever since. Currently I have a few portfolio projects hosted on netlify and even my personal website is hosted on Netlify. Great stuff!**


# Conclusion🧿
**I am delighted to help you all in some way😀. I hope you find my article interesting and enjoyed my website. I will keep working on it and improving it. Finally thanking @Hashnode and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting this amazing hackathon :) **
